Currently this needs bug23455 in the server, erlang client, and management (if
you're using that). Build it like any other plugin.

Example config stanza:

  {rabbit_auth_backend_ldap,
    [ {servers,         ["my-ldap-server1", "my-ldap-server-2"]},
      {user_dn_pattern, "cn=~s,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"} ] },

The user_dn_pattern must contain exactly one instance of "~s". This will be
where the username supplied by the client is subsitituted.

Currently all users authenticated by LDAP:

 * Are not administrators.
 * Can connect to any vhost.
 * Can do anything within a vhost.

These last two limitations will probably get removed at some point.
